0:00:02,800 --> 0:00:06.160
In this demo we will explore the different features available in the collab extension.

2
0:00:06,720 --> 0:00:08.200
On the screen, there's a one page Google Doc

3
0:00:08,200 --> 0:00:09.800
with about six paragraphs.

4
0:00:10,000 --> 0:00:13.400
There are several comments and suggested edits in the document.

5
0:00:13,400 --> 0:00:15.920
And two coauthors are right now active in this document.

6
0:00:16,640 --> 0:00:20.160
First, we want to know who is active in 

7

0:00:20.160,0:00:22.903

8
K


9
Screen reader: anonymous walrus is on page one paragraph five and line one


10
Screen reader: anonymous liger is on page one paragraph two and line one


11
So the screen reader told us the location of the coauthors


12
I want to know what my coauthors are doing,


13
However I don't want to lose my cursor 
position.

14
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42.000
To do that, I can press ctrl shift H

15
0:00:42,880 --> 0:00:44.212
Screen reader: Following anonymous walrus

16
0:00:44,212 --> 0:00:48.240
The screen reader told me that I'm now following anonymous walrus

17
0:00:48,880 --> 0:00:52.160
I can hear a typing sound as anonymous walrus writes

18
0:00:52,160 --> 0:00:57.440
which means that I can get a sense about when they're contributing to a document

19
0:00:57,440 --> 0:00:59.680
and when they're off doing something else.

20
0:01:02,240 --> 0:01:07.520
[Typing sound]

21
0:01:07,520 --> 0:01:10.218
Screen reader: Hello world. This is a test sentence.

22
0:01:10,218 --> 0:01:15.720
After they finish writing a line, I can hear what they just wrote on the past line.

23
0:01:15,720 --> 0:01:20.851
Now I want to jump to anonymous walrus's location to explore these edits more.

24
0:01:20,851 --> 0:01:23.655
I can do that by pressing control shift one.

25
0:01:23,655 --> 0:01:29.600
Screen reader: Moved cursor to anonymous walrus's location at page one paragraph six and line one.

26
0:01:31,040 --> 0:01:35.680
And here my screen reader told me that I've moved to anonymous walrus's cursor location

27
0:01:35,680 --> 0:01:40.400
I can repeatedly press ctrl shift H to rotate through the list of all active coauthors

28
0:01:40,400 --> 0:01:45.600
and select who I want to follow and eventually stop following any other coauthors.

29
0:01:45,600 --> 0:01:48.960
Now I want to explore the relative proximity cues which notifies me

30
0:01:48,960 --> 0:01:53.280
where my coauthors are relative to my location so that I don't type over other's edits.

31
0:01:53,280 --> 0:01:56.009
We have four different ways to get relative proximity notifications.

32
0:01:56,009 --> 0:01:58.209
I'll first select the spoken announcement option.

33
0:01:58,209 --> 0:02:01.840
Screen reader: spoken announcement 

34

0:02:01.840,0:02:07.000

35

0:02:07.000,0:02:09.040

36

0:02:10.560,0:02:12.508

37

0:02:12.508,0:02:15.520

38

0:02:16.400,0:02:19.000

39

0:02:19.000,0:02:23.019

40

0:02:23.019,0:02:26.320

41

0:02:27.840,0:02:30.531

42

0:02:30.531,0:02:35.840

43

0:02:37.840,0:02:45.120

44

0:02:45.120,0:02:51.000

45

0:02:51.000,0:02:57.040

46

0:02:57.040,0:03:00.027

47
features,


48
So -->  I'm going to select musical note pitch change in the relative proximity setting,


49
Screen reader: musical note pitch change selected,


50
Now -->  if one of my coauthors such 
as anonymous walrus enters my paragraph, I'll hear a musical note

51
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:24.320
If they come to the line where I have my cursor, a slightly higher pitched note occurs.

52
0:03:24,320 --> 0:03:31.360
If they place their cursor at the exact same spot where I am, an even higher pitched note happens.

53
0:03:31,360 --> 0:03:36.320
If they move away from my paragraph, then I hear a lower pitched note.

54
0:03:36,320 --> 0:03:38.800
What if anonymous liger enters my paragraph?

55
0:03:41,680 --> 0:03:45.120
So we hear tones of different 

56

0:03:45.120,0:03:51.360

57
that is distinct from anonymous walrus's,


58
So far in our exploration -->  the pitch of the 
musical note changed with

59
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:57.902
relative proximity between our cursors.

60
0:03:57,902 --> 0:04:01.627
So the closer the coauthor comes to my cursor, the higher the pitch gets.

61
0:04:01,627 --> 0:04:05.296
What will happen though if the note 

62

0:04:05.296,0:04:08.507

63

0:04:08.507,0:04:12.485

64

0:04:12.485,0:04:19.160

65

0:04:19.160,0:04:24.360

66

0:04:24.360,0:04:31.440

67

0:04:31.440,0:04:35.760

68

0:04:36.560,0:04:40.240

69

0:04:40.240,0:04:43.944

70

0:04:43.944,0:04:48.199

71

0:04:48.199,0:04:52.000

72
cursors,


73
To explore this feature -->  I'll first go to the audio scroll bar settings,


74
In the presentations options -->  I'll select paragraph scroll bar


75
because I want to navigate by paragraph,


76
Screen reader: Presentation option, Paragraph scroll bar selected.


77
In the scroll bar option -->  comments are selected by default,


78
And in the scroll bar sound option -->  we have pitch selected by default,


79
Now I'll press ctrl shift U to invoke the audio scroll bar,


80
Screen reader: audio scroll bar turned on


81
The screen reader told me that the audio scroll bar is turned on,


82
Now I'll press the up or down arrow key to get an audio indication of which paragraph has more or less comments,


83
For instance -->  the second paragraph has one comment, so we hear this sound


84
The next paragraph has two comments, 
So we hear a higher pitched sound.

85
0:05:38,880 --> 0:05:44.720
And then the next paragraph has four comments, and so we hear a much higher pitched sound.

86
0:05:46,560 --> 0:05:51.840
If we go to the last paragraph, there's 

87

0:05:54.720,0:05:57.341

88

0:05:57.341,0:06:01.200

89

0:06:01.200,0:06:05.840

90

0:06:07.040,0:06:09.680

91
about the comments or edits in the paragraph


92
I can press ctrl M after hearing the tone,


93
Screen reader: page one paragraph seven has two comments -->  zero 
other cursors, and four edits.

94
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:23.080
And the screen reader told me the number of edits, comments, and cursors in the paragraph.

95
0:06:23,080 --> 0:06:28.953
If I want to move my cursor to a paragraph to explore in more detail, I can press ctrl shift one.

96
0:06:28,953 --> 0:06:31.780
Screen reader: Moved to page one paragraph seven.

97
0:06:31,780 --> 0:06:35.400
I also want to check what happens if we 

98

0:06:35.400,0:06:38.289

99

0:06:38.289,0:06:41.120

100

0:06:41.120,0:06:43.800

101

0:06:43.800,0:06:50.113

102
keys to get an audio indication of which paragraph has more or less comments,


103
For example -->  the second paragraph has one comment, so we hear one tone,


104
The next paragraph has two comments -->  so we hear two tones,


105
And then the next paragraph has 
four comments. So we hear four tones.

106
0:07:10,880 --> 0:07:13.580
For five or more comments, we'll just hear five tones.

107
0:07:13,580 --> 0:07:19.600
So this way, using the audio scroll bar we can get a quick overview of how comments or edits are distributed in the document.
